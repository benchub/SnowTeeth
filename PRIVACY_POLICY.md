# Privacy Policy for SnowTeeth

**Last Updated:** November 1, 2025

## Introduction

SnowTeeth ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our GPS tracking application for outdoor activities.

## Our Privacy-First Approach

**SnowTeeth is designed with privacy at its core:**
- All data is stored locally on your device
- No cloud storage or syncing
- No user accounts or authentication required
- No third-party data sharing
- No advertising or tracking networks
- No analytics collection

## Information We Collect

### Location Data

SnowTeeth collects precise GPS location data when you enable tracking. This includes:
- Latitude and longitude coordinates
- Altitude/elevation
- Speed and direction
- Timestamps

**Purpose:** This data is used exclusively to calculate your activity statistics (distance, speed, elevation gain/loss) and provide real-time visualizations.

**Storage:** All location data is stored locally on your device in the app's private storage area.

**Retention:** Location data is retained until you manually delete it by clearing a tracking session.

### User Preferences

The app stores your configuration preferences locally, including:
- Velocity threshold settings
- Unit preferences (metric/imperial)
- Visualization style preferences

**Storage:** Preferences are stored locally using your device's standard settings storage.

## How We Use Your Information

Location data collected by SnowTeeth is used solely for:
1. **Real-time visualization** - Displaying your current speed and activity level
2. **Statistics calculation** - Computing distance, elevation gain/loss, and pace
3. **GPX export** - Allowing you to save and share your activity data at your discretion

We do **not** use your data for:
- Marketing or advertising
- User profiling or analytics
- Sale or transfer to third parties
- Cross-app or cross-website tracking

## Data Sharing

**SnowTeeth does not share your data with any third parties.** Period.

The only way your location data leaves your device is if you explicitly choose to export a GPX file and share it yourself through your device's sharing mechanisms (email, messaging, etc.).

## Data Export

You have complete control over your data:
- **Export GPX files** - Save your tracking session as a standard GPX file
- **Share at your discretion** - Use your device's built-in sharing to send GPX files to apps or services of your choice
- **Delete anytime** - Clear tracking sessions to permanently delete location data

When you export a GPX file, it contains:
- GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude, elevation)
- Timestamps
- No personally identifiable information

## Children's Privacy

SnowTeeth does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 (or applicable age in your jurisdiction). The app does not require registration, and all data remains on the device.

## Location Permission

SnowTeeth requires location permission to function:
- **iOS:** "Allow While Using App" or "Allow Always" (for background tracking)
- **Android:** "Precise location" and "Allow all the time" (for background tracking)

You can revoke location permission at any time through your device settings. Without location permission, the app cannot track your activity.

## Background Location

When you enable tracking and put the app in the background (e.g., lock your phone while skiing), SnowTeeth continues to collect location data to maintain continuous tracking. This data is still stored only on your device and used only for the purposes described above.

## Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your data:
- All data stored locally in the app's private, sandboxed storage
- iOS/Android system-level encryption applies to app data
- No network transmission of location data (unless you export and share GPX files)

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:
- **Access:** View your tracking history within the app
- **Export:** Save your data as GPX files
- **Delete:** Clear sessions to permanently delete data
- **Control:** Enable/disable tracking at any time

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Third-Party Services

SnowTeeth does **not** use any third-party services, including:
- No analytics platforms (Google Analytics, Firebase, etc.)
- No crash reporting services
- No advertising networks
- No social media integrations
- No cloud storage providers

## International Users

SnowTeeth can be used anywhere in the world. All data processing occurs locally on your device, regardless of your location.

## Legal Basis (GDPR)

For users in the European Economic Area, our legal basis for processing location data is:
- **Consent:** By enabling tracking, you consent to location data collection
- **Legitimate Interest:** Processing is necessary to provide the core functionality you requested
